html-layout
===========

Inside each folder you'll find an image. That image contains the layout you need to build with HTML and CSS. The 'first' folder contains an index.html and a style.css file. In the other folders you'll need to add them yourself. *Your first step should be connecting your CSS sheet with your HTML sheet.
