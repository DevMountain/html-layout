html-layout
===========

##Objective
Understand HTML and its uses in layout by completing a series of tasks

##Directions
Fork this repo then clone your fork onto your local machine. Inside each folder you'll find an image. That image contains the layout you need to build with HTML and CSS. The 'first' folder contains an index.html and a style.css file. In the other folders, you'll need to add them yourself. *Your first step should be connecting your CSS sheet with your HTML sheet.*

## Contributions
If you see a problem or a typo, please fork, make the necessary changes, and create a pull request so we can review your changes and merge them into the master repo and branch.
