html-layout
===========

##Objective
Understanding HTML and its uses in layout by completing a series of tasks.

##Directions
Fork this repo and then clone your fork onto your local machine. Inside each folder you'll find an image that contains the layout you need to build with HTML and CSS. The 'first' folder contains an index.html file and a style.css file. For the other folders, you'll need to add them yourself. *Your first step should be connecting your CSS sheet with your HTML sheet.*

## Contributions
If you find a problem or a typo, please fork, make the necessary changes, and create a pull request so we can review your changes and merge them into the master repo and branch.
