		<p>Consider hiding the satus bar-and all other app UI-while people are actively viewing full-screen media. If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people retrieve it (and the appropriate app UI) with a single tap. Unless you have a compelling reason to do so, avoid defining a custom gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture or to remember it.</p>
