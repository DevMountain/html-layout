			Mr. Boehner, 65 years old, faced more opposition from his party’s right flank than in years past, but not enough to oust him from the House’s top post. After being selected among House Republicans for the post in November, he was officially re-elected in a floor roll-call vote, as the new Congress—now fully controlled by Republicans—convened on Tuesday. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R., Texas) and Florida GOP Reps. Ted Yoho and Daniel Webster all received a sprinkling of votes from House Republicans unhappy with Mr. Boehner’s leadership. Conservatives defecting from Mr. Boehner said they objected to how he ran the House, faulting him for hashing out too many deals behind closed doors and not giving lawmakers enough time to read legislation before voting.
